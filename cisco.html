            <!--
            -->
            
            <p>	During the Summer of 2016, I interned as a UX Designer and Researcher for <a href="https://www.opendns.com/">OpenDNS</a>, a part <a href="http://www.cisco.com/c/m/en_us/never-better/security.html">Cisco</a>. OpenDNS is a DNS resolution and cybersecurity company that was acquired by Cisco in 2015. During my summer, I worked on Cisco Umbrella - a new SaaS enterprise security product. 
                
            <p>I spent the summer designing a new user flow for cybersecurity and IT professionals that manage security policies. I also leveraged research methods such as customer calls, usage data, and remote testing to start a large research effort. 
            </p>

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p class="project"> I worked with Stephanie to re-design t Security Policy Management and Creation. "How can we tailor the experience to ensure that users are making the most powerful configuration relevant to them?" "How can we make this as simple and streamlined as possible? </p>
                
            <p>I had the opportunity to create a new interaction pattern that will be incorporated into the final Umbrella design. In designing for an enterprise platform, I became more experienced with an conscience of designing for accesibility.  
            </p>

            <h4>Research</h4>
            <h4>Identifying Opportunities from Customer Calls</h4>
            <p>I worked with project managers and customer success representatives to conduct customer calls. Because the UX team was handling a massage overhaul of the product, we wanted to ensure that customers and users would be involved in the design process. In conducting customer calls and sending customer surveys, we identified certain needs like increased customizability and flexibility for policy creation. We also shared designs from the new policy creation process with overwhelmingly positive reactions. Based on these reactions, we felt more confident going forward with the development process. 
            </p>
            
            <br>

            <h4>Evaluating Solutions through Remote Testing</h4>
            <p>
            I designed and deployed 8 different remote usability studies. This work was used to evaluate a new table pattern, a new data visualization, a navigation interaction, website IA, button placement, and other design patterns. During my research process, I utilized techniques such as task-analysis, A/B testing, card sorting, and tree testing. I also incorporated survey questions from the System Usability Scale into these studies to gain further insight. 
            </p>
             
            <br>
                
            <h4>Informing Decisions with Usage Data</h4>
            <p>I utilized usage data to understand how users were currently using the product. I guaged how important certain configurations were based on how many people were actually using them. With this insight, I decided whether or not certain features from the original OpenDNS Umbrella product would be implementing in Cisco Umbrella.

            <h4>Reflections</h4>
            <p>What did I learn over the summer?</p>
