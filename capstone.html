            <h2></h2>
            <p>Animal shelters provide crucial services to promote animal welfare that include the prosecution and prevention of animal abuse or neglect. However, investigations are complicated. 

            <ul class="text-list">
                <li>Concerned, well-meaning citizens get confused, often contact the wrong authority, too late and without the necessary evidence</li>
                <li> Staff officers are overwhelmed without this evidence and can't prosecute animal cases the necessary action taking action and successfully prosecuting criminal cases.</li> 
            </ul>
    
            <p>We worked with the Humane Animal Rescue shelter to understand how technology could better support animal welfare through a service design framework.</p>
<!--             <ul class="text-list">
                <li>How can we support the shelter’s humane officer in managing and investigating humane cases?</li>
                <li>How can we improve citizens' experiences in reporting cases?</li>
            </ul> -->

            <!-- <p> For this project, I first served as the exploratory research lead. For the latter I focused my efforts on a lot of the visual design for this project.</p> -->

            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>EXPLORATORY RESEARCH</h3> 
            <p>We used a variety of methonds including a literature review, competitive analysis, and interview to understand the entire problem space. By the end of this process we became experts in animal laws and humane investigations.</p>

            <h3 id='s3' class='section'>SYNTHESIZING INSIGHTS</h3>
                
                <p>Based on our research, we conducted affinity diagramming and create models to communicate our insights. We discovered 5 main insights.</p>
                <h2>1. The main goal of animal rescue is to educate, not confiscate</h2>
                 <div class="project-img-div-med">
                        <img class="project-img-med" src="assets/capstone/ho-flow.png" alt="Humane Officer Workflow">
                </div>
                <h4>We modeled the typical workflow of a humane officer as they investigate cases. </h4>

                <p>A humane officer’s primary role is to educate by giving people the resources necessary to care for their animals. Interviewed highlighted that officers give as many resources to the animal owner as possible, rather than immediately taking the animal. </p>
                <h2>2. Laws are complicated and don't match people's assumptions</h2>
                <p>Citizens don’t know what legally constitutes animal abuse, sometimes reporting cases that aren't abuse. There are multiple layers of laws and current resources are difficult for citizens to find and comprehend. </p>
               
                <h2>3. Misreporting can have serious consequences for the organization, people, and animals involved</h2>
                <p>Reporters often provide incomplete information and even false information. This leads to serious drains on the already limited resources of the humane officer. </p>
                <h2>5. For citizen reporters, lack of feedback after reporting is frustrating and disheartening.</h2>
                <div class="project-img-div-small">
                        <img class="project-img-small" src="assets/capstone/feedback.png" alt="Cultural Model">
                </div>
                <p>Currently, citizens get no feedback about cases. Without this feedback, citizens become concerned that nothing is being done and question whether their actions have actually helped the situation.</p>

                     <ul class="text-list">
                         <li>We should reduce the work on the humane officer. </li>
                   <li>Make it easier for citizens to provide the correct information </li>
                    <li>Educate citizens about actual animal laws</li></ul>

            <h3 id='s4' class='section'>IDEATION</h3>
             <h2>Co-creating imagined futures</h2>
            <p>Working off our our insights, we hosted a participatory design session with our clients. This was meant to better understand their goals and to generate a wide variety of ideas.</p>

            </div>
            <h2>Testing our hypothesis by speed dating</h2>
            <p>After coming up with a variety of scenarios, we tested our concepts through speed dating sessions with a variety of potential users. Based on this fedback, we were able to prioritize key features for our solutions. </p>
