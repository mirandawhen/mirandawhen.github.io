            <h2>How is brainstorming useful for groups in creative disciplines?</h2>
            <p>Brainstorming is an activity often prescribed in creative programs to promote group work. But, simply telling students to brainstorm together is not enough. I aimed to figure out features that represented succesful group work.
                                
            <br>  
                
            <br><br>
          
            <div class="space15px"></div><br>
            <h3 id='s2' class='section'>FRAMEWORKS</h3> 
            <h2>Brainstorming involves the generation, evaluation, and refinement of ideas.</h2>
            <p>Previous literature frames has emphsazied brainstorming as an activity focused on the generation of ideas. However, this investigation focuses on the open-ended nature of brainstorming as an explorative activity</p>
            <h2>Don't forget the "group" in group brainstorming</h2>
            <p>To ensure that individual members have equal ownership and influence over the entire design, participation in brainstorming activities is necessary. As such, joint participation is emphasized when considering successful group brainstorming.</p>

            <h2>Members can utilize tools and techniques to articulate ideas to the group</h2>
            <p>Participation in group brainstorming is constrained by the type of resources available for communication. Furthermore, mastery and expertise in different mediums also impacted participation.</p>

            <h2>Synchronous Conversation facilitates immediate feedback and quick refinements</h2>
             <h4>“You can discuss things really quickly and simply. You need to hear other people’s perspectives as you’re coming up with ideas.”</h4>
            <p>Synchronous conversation is a feature for successful brainstorming because it mediates immediate feedback that, in turn, supports the brainstorming activities of joint generation and refinement.</p>


            <h2>Members Demonstrate that an Individual’s Contribution is Socially Relevant</h2>
            <p>Participation in group brainstorming is constrained by the type of resources available for communication. Furthermore, mastery and expertise in different mediums also impacted participation.</p>

                <li>It makes sense to target users in the tech industry as a starting point, as there are a lot of resources in this industry and these blog platforms rooted in the tech industry have shown success.</li>
                <li>MyBridge users liked the "only 10 articles a day" model.</li>
                <li>Progress tracking is a shared important aspect of all the education apps.</li>
                <li>All the reading apps have the following features: 1. favorite/save 2. categorization 3. Blog recommendations</li>

            <h3 id='s6' class='section'>CONCLUSIONS</h3>
            <h2>Use strategies to help users maximize their learning</h2>
            <p>There are two different ways to measure whether users are maximizing their learning experience in Replay: 1. Number of articles read intentionally; 2. Number of blogs sites that they finish reading. I used the following strategies to achieve these goals.  
          </p>

          <br><br>
          <h2>Be mindful of human factors</h2>
          <p>This is a detail that I paid attention to during user testing. The original filter design allows more space to show blog titles, but when user wants to exit out of it, it's really hard to reach the "X" icon. In the next iteration, I reduced the height of the filter overlay to about half of the screen to make the experience more "human finger friendly".</p>

        <br><br>
          <h2>Creating an awesome reading experience through visual design</h2>
          <p>I decided to use Helvetica for all the typography in this app, because I want a typeface that everyone finds familiar and has great legibility. I also used different font weights, colors, and sizes to create a clear information hierarchy.</p>

            <h3 id='s7' class='section'>REFLECTIONS</h3>

                <p>As a student that takes classes in creative disciplines, this project was very useful for  myself. It helped me understand ways to better work in creative groups. Some lessons I learned include the following:  
                </p>
          <ul class="text-list">
                <li>Defining success in academic settings is difficult and contingent on your pedagogical framework </li>
                <li>Build upon <b>current work</b> to supplement existing bodies of knowledge</li>
                <li><b>Visual design is a crucial part of the overall experience</b>, especially when the function of the app is heavily dependent on the information hierarchy and legibility of the content.</li>
                </ul>
